# Portfolio Website

> Portfolio Professional Website

This is a portfolio website proof of concept. This will not be my actual portfolio website as I do not like its design but
this was for a class project. It features a working nav bar, placeholder links for portfolio projects, and contact info and links to access their work.

## Installation

The deployed website can be accessed at the below link.

## Release History

Feel free to go through each commit, but the gist is that I started without mobile-first design in mind. Realized a couple days into my project that it was going to be a nightmare to try and reformat down to mobile. So I started over late in the process to focus on mobile-first. I think I learned a good lesson from this project even though it certainly isn't my best work and I do not plan to use it as my actual portfolio without major overhauls.
